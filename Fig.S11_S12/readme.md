# Figure S11 and S12
The code and data in this directory can be used to generate the supplementary figures in S11 and S12.

The code is in MATLAB format, but is not particularly complicated and all the data is present.

We also included a bonus figure in response to [an excellent and eagle-eyed question from Kresten Lindorff-Larsen](https://twitter.com/LindorffLarsen/status/1296471721311182849?s=20). Thanks Kresten!
